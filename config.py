"""
UBI Bot — Configuration
All settings in one place. MVP keeps it simple.

Sensitive values (BOT_TOKEN, ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID) are loaded from a .env file
via python-dotenv. Copy .env.example to .env and fill in real values before
running.

Using load_dotenv() at startup ensures values are always read fresh from the
file — this is critical after os.execv() reboots, where the new process
inherits the parent's (possibly stale) environment rather than a clean shell.

For production (systemd): set EnvironmentFile= in your service unit pointing
to your secrets file, and load_dotenv() will be a no-op (env vars already set).
